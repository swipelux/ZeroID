# Chat GPT Messenger with ZeroID Integration

This web application showcases the integration of ZeroID for secure and decentralized identity and data management in a chat interface powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. Users can engage in conversations with the chatbot, with the added benefit of ZeroID for enhanced privacy and data control.

## Main Idea

The central concept of this project is to demonstrate how ZeroID can be seamlessly integrated into applications to enhance user privacy and data management. Key aspects of the integration include:

1. **Decentralized Identity**: ZeroID provides users with decentralized identity management, enabling them to interact with the application without relying on centralized authentication methods.

2. **Data Control**: ZeroID allows users to maintain control over their data, including chat conversations, in a secure and private manner.

3. **User-Centric Approach**: The project prioritizes user privacy and data ownership, aligning with the principles of decentralized applications.

4. **Secure Communication**: All user interactions with the chatbot are secured through ZeroID, ensuring that user data remains private and confidential.
